<h2> About me </h2>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Pranay" width="150">

I live in London and work at the University of Cambridge (yes, there is a commute!) and The Alan Turing Institute. I studied engineering at Cambridge and previously at Maryland. My research focuses on uncertainty quantification, optimization 
and machine learning applied to address challenges in aeroengines. I am the founder of <a href="https://www.effective-quadratures.org">Effective Quadratures</a>. <br>

My current research projects are:
<ul>
    <li>Bayesian models in aeroengines</li>
    <li>Subspace-based dimension reduction: algorithms and design</li>
    <li>Machine learning with polynomials: from quadratures to neural networks</li>
</ul>
