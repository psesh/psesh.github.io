<p class="thick">About me.</p>
I live in London and work at the University of Cambridge and The Alan Turing Institute. I studied computational engineering at Cambridge and aerospace engineering previously at Maryland. During my doctorate I worked at Rolls-Royce plc in Derby and spent time at Stanford. <br> My research focuses on uncertainty quantification, optimisation 
and machine learning applied to address challenges in aeroengines. <br> <br>I am the founder of <a href="https://www.effective-quadratures.org">Effective Quadratures</a>. <br>
<br>
My current research projects are:
<ul>
    <li>Bayesian models for improved aerothermal flow-physics in engines</li>
    <li>Subspace-based dimension reduction: algorithms and 3D blade design</li>
    <li>Machine learning with polynomials: from quadratures to neural networks</li>
</ul>
For all my publications, please check out <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DwcnM0MAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pranay_Seshadri2">Researchgate.</a>

<br>
Beyond this, I am passionate about numerical linear algebra and its applications. Last year I organized the first <a href="https://www.cambridge-class.org">CLASS (Cambridge Linear Algebra Seminar Series)</a> focused on solving Ax=b. It was a lot of fun!
