    excerpt: 'I live in London and work at the University of Cambridge and the Alan Turing Institute. I studied engineering at Cambridge and previously worked at Rolls-Royce. My research interests lie at the intersection of aeronautics and machine learning. I am the founder of [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org). My current research projects include:
    - Bayesian aerothermal models in aero-engines
    - Subspace-based dimension reduction: methods and design
    - Machine learning with polynomials: from quadratures to neural networks.'
