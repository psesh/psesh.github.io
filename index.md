excerpt: "I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge and also a Group Leader in the Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute. My team's research is funded by Rolls-Royce plc, the Lloyd's Register Foundation and UK Research and Innovation."
intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I undertake research in *data-centric aeronautics*: applying existing, and developing novel, data-driven algorithms in **turbomachinery aerothermodynamics** and **machine learning** for better aerodynamic inference and decision-making. My research interests vary from statistical theory and numerical linear algebra to turbomachinery applications. Explore my current projects below.'
