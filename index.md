I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. I am also a Group Leader in the Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute. I trained as a computational engineer with a focus in aerodynamics. 

More broadly, my interests include:

- dimension reduction
- measurement uncertainty quantification
- polynomial approximations
- applications in turbomachinery design and manufacturing
