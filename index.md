I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. I am also a Group Leader in the Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute. I trained as a computational engineer with a focus in aerodynamics. 

More broadly, my interests include:

- dimension reduction algorithms
- measurement uncertainty quantification techniques
- constructing stable polynomial approximations
- dimension reduction in turbomachinery design and manufacturing

I am the founder and lead developer of the [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org) open-source project. Our goal is to  solve a range of problems in machine learning, uncertainty quantification and optimization using polynomials!

I am currently organizing the Cambridge Linear Algebra Seminar Series (CLASS): a two-and-a-half day series of seminars on topics in numerical linear algebra. This year the focus of our seminars is *Solving Ax=b*. Registration and seminar details can be found at the [CLASS website](https://www.cambridge-class.org).
