I live in London and work at the University of Cambridge and the Alan Turing Institute. I previously studied engineering at Cambridge and worked at Rolls-Royce.
I am the founder of [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org). My research interests are:
- Bayesian aerothermal models
- Subspace-based dimension reduction
- Machine learning via polynomial approximations.
