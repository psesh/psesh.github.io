I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk). I am also a Group Leader in the [Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). I trained as a computational engineer with a focus in turbomachinery aerodynamics. 

I undertake research in *data-centric aeronautics*: applying existing, and developing novel, data-driven algorithms in **turbomachinery** and **machine learning** for better aerodynamic inference and decision-making. My research interests vary from statistical theory and numerical analysis to turbomachinery applications.

My current research projects include:
- Bayesian regression for engine thermodynamic spatial field approximation;
- Manifold learning for dimension reduction in turbomachinery design;
- Image classification using sparse data.

For an overview of my research, do check a talk I gave at the Alan Turing Institute:

I am the founder and lead developer of the [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org) open-source project. Our goal is to  solve a range of problems in machine learning, uncertainty quantification and optimization using polynomials!

I am the director of the Cambridge Linear Algebra Seminar Series (CLASS) 2018. Last year the focus of our seminars was on *Solving Ax=b*; details can be found at the [CLASS website](https://www.cambridge-class.org). Stay tuned for CLASS2019 which will be on *Polynomials, splines and neural networks*.
