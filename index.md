I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk). I am also a Group Leader in the [Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). I trained as a computational engineer with a focus in aerodynamics. 

My research area is *aerospace data-centric engineering*: applying existing, and developing novel data-driven algorithms and computational heuristics to aerospace data for better inference and decision-making. 

More specifically, my research interests include:

- subspace-based dimension reduction algorithms 
- measurement uncertainty quantification techniques in aerospace
- dimension reduction aided pedigree rules in turbomachinery design and manufacturing
- constructing global and local polynomial approximations for aerospace models

I am the founder and lead developer of the [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org) open-source project. Our goal is to  solve a range of problems in machine learning, uncertainty quantification and optimization using polynomials!

I am currently organizing the Cambridge Linear Algebra Seminar Series (CLASS): a two-and-a-half day series of seminars on topics in numerical linear algebra. This year the focus of our seminars is *Solving Ax=b*. Registration and seminar details can be found at the [CLASS website](https://www.cambridge-class.org).
