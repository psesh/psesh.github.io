I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk). I am also a Group Leader in the [Data-Centric Engineering Programme at the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). My team's research is funded by [Rolls-Royce plc](https://www.rolls-royce.com), the [Lloyd's Register Foundation](https://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/en/) and [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org).

<h3>Research overview</h3>
I undertake research in *data-centric aeronautics*: applying existing, and developing novel, data-driven algorithms in **turbomachinery aerothermodynamics** and **machine learning** for better aerodynamic inference and decision-making. My research interests vary from statistical theory and numerical linear algebra to turbomachinery applications.

My current research projects include:
- Gaussian process models for engine thermodynamic spatial field approximation;
- Manifold learning for dimension reduction in turbomachinery design;
- Polynomial techniques for optimization and sensitivity analysis for CFD data-sets.

<h3>Effective Quadratures</h3>
I am the founder and lead developer of the [Effective Quadratures](https://www.effective-quadratures.org) open-source project. Our goal is to  solve a range of problems in machine learning, uncertainty quantification and optimization using polynomials! The Effective Quadratures 2019 Workshop is on July 1st 2019! [Click here for more details.](https://www.effective-quadratures.org/workshop2019)

<h3>International Workshop on Data-Centric Engineering</h3>
I am one of the organizing chairs of the [International Workshop on Data-Centric Engineering](https://dceworkshop.org). The aim of this workshop is to put together a unified vision for how data-centric methods can empower engineering research. The workshop will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 9-12 of December 2019.

<h3>CLASS</h3>
I am the director of the Cambridge Linear Algebra Seminar Series (CLASS) 2018. Last year the focus of our seminars was on *Solving Ax=b*; details can be found at the [CLASS website](https://www.cambridge-class.org). Stay tuned for CLASS2019 which will be on *Polynomials, splines and neural networks*.
