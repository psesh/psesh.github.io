My group is split between the University of Cambridge and the Alan Turing Institute in London. Our research output is usually aimed at solving a pertinent aerospace problem by developing new (or using existing) computational methods in uncertainty quantification, optimization and machine learning. 

## Members.
- **Name**, *Postdoctoral Fellow*: Working on using polynomial approximations to solve problems that have been typically solved by neural networks.

- **Nicholas Wong**, *PhD student*: Joinly advised with Geoff Parks. Nicholas is working on dimension reduction strategies for gaining new insights into manufacturing blades. He was previously a Masters student with us and worked on compressive sensing methods for polynomial approximations. 

-  **Irene Virdis**, *Visiting PhD student*: Joinly advised with Tiziano Ghisu. Irene is studying various strategies for generating correlated quadrature rules for aleatory uncertainty quantification in numerical simulations of turbine blades. 

## Former Members.
- **Henry Yuchi** *Former masters student, Currently PhD student in Georgia Tech*: Henry studied polynomial variable projection techniques for input subspace-based dimension reduction with applications to fan blade design.
