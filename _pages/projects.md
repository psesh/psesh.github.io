My research projects are detailed below. They have been funded by an EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship, Rolls-Royce plc and The Alan Turing Institite.

### Studying manufacturing tolerances using dimension reduction
This project builds upon prior work on turbomachinery design space exploration with dimension reduction methods, see [paper](http://turbomachinery.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2668256). The central idea is to re-examine how manufacturing tolerances are prescribed and determined and how designs that are invariant to manufacturing variations can be conceived. 

### Temperature measurement uncertainty quantification
This project is motivated by the impact of an uncertainty in temperature on jet engine efficiency estimation. The goal is to provide a rigorous framework for characterizing jet engine temperature uncertainty given finite thermocouple measurements. As part of this project we are studying evaluating existing techniques for averaging and quantifying experimental uncertainty. 

### Quadratures for polynomial approximation and numerical integration
Gauss quadrature is *optimal* in 1D in the sense that it minimizes the Lebesgue constant. But how do we find quadrature rules that are optimal (or near) optimal for dimensions greater than 2? How do we find quadrature rules that can leverage low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional functions? We leverage ideas from numerical linear algebra and convex optimization, see [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07296.pdf). Lately, we have also been exploring techniques for tackling correlated input variables. 

### Polynomial regression in data science
This project applies polynomial regression with localization to solve problems in data science and machine learning.
