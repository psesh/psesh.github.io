My research projects are detailed below.

### Studying manufacturing tolerances using dimension reduction
This project builds upon prior work on turbomachinery design space exploration with dimension reduction methods. The central idea is to re-examine how manufacturing tolerances are prescribed and determined and how designs that are invariant to manufacturing variations can be conceived. 

### Temperature measurement uncertainty quantification
This project is motivated by the impact of an uncertainty in temperature on jet engine efficiency estimation. The goal is to provide a rigorous framework for characterizing jet engine temperature uncertainty given finite thermocouple measurements. 

### Quadrature strategies for polynomial approximation
Gauss quadrature is optimal in 1D. But how do we find quadrature rules that are optimal (or near) optimal for dimensions greater than 2? How do we find quadrature rules that can leverage ridge-like structures. 

### Polynomial regression in data science
This project applies polynomial regression with localization to solve problems in data science and machine learning.
